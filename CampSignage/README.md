# How do we have **WIFI** in the middle of this desolate hellscape???

**Black Rock City** needs reliable Internet connectivity for several organizational functions (ticketing, logistics, medical, public safety, etc.).

The **Burning Man Network Operations Team** provides this through a variety of technologies that are designed to operate in this complex environment and obtain connectivity back to &quot;civilization&quot; (commercial Internet fiber peering and transit).

This is a challenging but critical function, one of many parts of the **incredible behind-the-scenes engineering effort** that happens each year to make Burning Man possible.

The Network Operations Team (thanks Cat -^..^- !!) **provides surplus bandwidth as a gift to camps** , to support their art and to offer to participants.

Connectivity is blanketed across the playa using a series of **directional point-to-multipoint radios on a 60ft tower near Center Camp**.  These radios use a special protocol similar to (but not identical to) 5ghz WiFi to optimize for reliable distribution to camps:

|   |   |
|---|---|
| ![Sector map of Burning Man](images/SectorMap.png)  |  Camps that want connectivity must:<br><br><ol><li>Obtain and configure a compatible radio</li><li>Safely obtain line-of-sight to the Center Camp tower</li><li>Provide the radio with a reliable source of powero</li><li>Provide some mechanism (2.4ghz wifi, etcâ€¦) for distributing connectivity within their camp.o</li>  |

**Engineering in this complex environment is part of our artistic expression and our gift to fellow participants.**

**We&#39;re glad that you&#39;ve stopped by!**
